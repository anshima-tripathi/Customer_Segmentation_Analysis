# \## 🎯 Project Objective

# 

# The goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and spending patterns using \*\*K-Means Clustering\*\*.  

# This helps businesses personalize marketing campaigns and enhance customer retention.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🧩 Business Understanding

# 

# In today’s data-centric environment, understanding customers beyond basic demographics is critical.  

# By clustering customers based on behavior, we can identify:

# 

# \- High-value customers 👑  

# \- Potential churners ⚠️  

# \- Price-sensitive buyers 💸  

# \- Opportunity segments for cross-selling \& upselling 🚀

#

# 

# \## 📊 Dataset Overview

# 

# The dataset contains information such as:

# 

# | Feature | Description |

# |----------|--------------|

# | `CustomerID` | Unique customer identifier |

# | `Age` | Age of the customer |

# | `Annual Income (k$)` | Annual income in thousand dollars |

# | `Spending Score (1-100)` | Spending behavior score assigned by the mall |

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🧠 Approach

# 

# 1\. \*\*Data Cleaning \& Preprocessing\*\*

# &nbsp;  - Handling missing values

# &nbsp;  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`

# 

# 2\. \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\*

# &nbsp;  - Distribution plots

# &nbsp;  - Correlation heatmaps

# &nbsp;  - Pairplots for feature interaction

# 

# 3\. \*\*Model Building\*\*

# &nbsp;  - Optimal K selection using \*\*Elbow Method\*\*

# &nbsp;  - Customer grouping using \*\*K-Means Clustering\*\*

# 

# 4\. \*\*Visualization\*\*

# &nbsp;  - Cluster visualization (2D scatter)

# &nbsp;  - Spending vs Income relationships

# &nbsp;  - Elbow curve

# \## 🖼️ Visualizations

# 

# | Visualization | Description |

# |----------------|--------------|

# | 📉 \*\*Elbow Method Plot\*\* | Helps identify optimal number of clusters (K) |

# | 🎯 \*\*Cluster Plot\*\* | Shows customer group segmentation |

# | 🔥 \*\*Correlation Heatmap\*\* | Displays relationships between variables |

# \## 🧮 Tech Stack

# 

# \- \*\*Language:\*\* Python 🐍  

# \- \*\*Libraries:\*\* pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  

# \- \*\*Environment:\*\* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🚀 Future Scope

# 

# \- Integrate advanced clustering (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

# \- Deploy via Streamlit dashboard for business teams

# \- Automate insights using a reporting pipeline

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🏁 Results \& Insights

# 

# \- \*\*Optimal Clusters:\*\* 5 (using Elbow Method)

# \- \*\*Segment Insights:\*\*

# &nbsp; - Cluster 1: High income, high spend → \*Premium customers\*

# &nbsp; - Cluster 2: Low income, low spend → \*Budget segment\*

# &nbsp; - Cluster 3: Young, moderate spend → \*Growth potential\*

# &nbsp; 

# These insights enable data-driven marketing \& product strategy decisions.
